# Rhythm Maker

## Synopsis

This is a java application built with the JMusic and Swing libraries.
The documentation for the JMusic library can be found [here](http://explodingart.com/jmusic/jmDocumentation/index.html).

The application gives you the ability to input a string of Notes and rests and
play them back to hear what they would sound like. The application is designed
specifically for students to help them understand what a rhythm is supposed
to sound like.
